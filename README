# Project 3 - Parsetagram Part 1:

**Parsetamgram** is a photo sharing app similar to Instagram but using Parse as its backend.

I used the same repository for part 1 and 2 so I have combined the readme files by adding part 2s required field to this document.
Since I am submitting them at the same time I hope that does not cause an issue. If it does I will go back and split up the code.

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can sign up to create a new account using Parse authentication.
- [x] User can log in and log out of his or her account.
- [x] The current signed in user is persisted across app restarts.
- [x] User can take a photo, add a caption, and post it to "Instagram".
- [x] User can view the last 20 posts submitted to "Instagram".
- [x] The user should switch between different tabs - viewing all posts (feed view), compose (capture photos form camera) and profile tabs (posts made) using fragments and a Bottom Navigation View. (2 points)
- [x] User can pull to refresh the last 20 posts submitted to "Instagram".


The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User sees app icon in home screen and styled bottom navigation view
- [ ] Style the feed to look like the real Instagram feed.
- [ ] After the user submits a new post, show an indeterminate progress bar while the post is being uploaded to Parse.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
